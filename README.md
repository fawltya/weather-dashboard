# Peep Show Quiz

## Description

An app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to show a weather forecast for the users input.

Searches are saved in local storage so can be used if returning to the site.

I've used a number of new or recently learned frameworks and APIs in this project: Luxon to display the current time, Tailwind with daisyUI to style the display (no css file at all), jQuery and the OpenWeatherMap.


## Installation

To view the page visit [fawltya.github.io/weather-dashboard](https://fawltya.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Usage

Input the place you would like to know the weather forecast for. Create a list of previously searched.
